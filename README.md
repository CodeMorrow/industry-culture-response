My responses to Week 7's Questions

1. The Set-Up-To-Fail Syndrome

This article is very long. You can stop reading once you get to the "Getting It Right" section, if you want.

Questions

In the example scenarios posited by the researchers, do you feel that either the bosses or subordinates acted out of ill-will? Who do you feel was most at fault? If it's difficult for you to choose, why?
2. How do tech’s biggest companies compare on diversity?

A: Diversity in Tech

1.Take a look at the chart labeled "Diversity in Tech". The default view is set to men of all races. 2. Click the button to show women. Note that while men represent an average of 71% of a company’s workers, women represent 29%. 3. Click back to show the default view of men of all ethnicities. Now click through the racial categories. For each category, toggle the gender selection. Compare these numbers to national workforce demographics featured at the top of the article.

Questions

Did any of these numbers surprise you? What do you think contributes to the disparity between these demographics' overall workforce share and share of the tech workforce?
B: Diversity in Leadership

Repeat the process from Part 1 for the "Diversity in Leadership" chart. Compare data for each company against the same data for that company in the previous chart.

Questions

Are all groups represented in management the way they are in the general tech workforce? Who is under-represented? Over-represented?
Think back to previous jobs you've had or jobs you've aspired to have. Did you see people you identified with as leaders in those professions? Was that important to you? Why or why not?
3. The Other Side of Diversity

Questions

Baker's essay focuses on the personal impact on being one of the few under-represented folks in tech who get through to the other end of the job pipeline. What was something that you found remarkable about her on-the-job experience?
How much should a new employee be expected to change to fit the mold of the industry or company they are entering?
4. Is Blind Hiring the Best Hiring?

Questions

Do you think blind-hiring is a sufficient solution to addressing industry biases?
To see if you can you see even a small part of both sides, also describe some of the arguments against your answer.
How would you compare blind-hiring to a diversity-first hiring proccess, like affirmative action?
