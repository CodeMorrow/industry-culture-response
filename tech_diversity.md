How do tech’s biggest companies compare on diversity?

A: Diversity in Tech

While looking at these numbers I compared the total race numbers and the total numbers in tech. White people make up 60% of tech while making up 63% of the national population. Hispanics make up 8% of tech while making up 16% of the national population. African Americans make up 7% of tech while making up 12% of the national population. The most surprising number was the fact the Asians make up 23% of tech while making up only 4% of the National population. 

I believe that Hispanics and African Americans have lower numbers in tech do to the higher poverty levels. According to https://www.census.gov, 25% of African Americans, 23% of Hispanics, 12% of Asians, and 12% of Whites are below the poverty line. Most can assume those below the poverty line aren't expose to technology as much as those above the poverty line. It’s impossible to become interested in tech when the availability to the community is minimal.

B: Diversity in Leadership

According to the information in the Diversity in Tech Leadership chart, the groups are not represented the same as the general workforce. While the general workforce is 60% whites, the leadership positions in tech are 79% white. All other groups are under-represented in leadership position in relation to the general workforce (Hispanics 3%, African Americans 2%, Asians 15%). 

In my previous work experience most of the leadership positions were occupied by people I identify with. It is not important to me to share a race with my superior. Rather I want a boss that is kind, fair, and personable. A boss that wants employees to develop and succeed is the important factor, not race or gender.
