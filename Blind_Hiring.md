Is Blind Hiring the Best Hiring?

Blind-hiring as many great aspects. The main aspect being a person is hired for their skill and not what they look or at like. I believe it is a good way of removing the racial/personality bias some companies possess. Hiring people bases on their skills and not by where they went to school or where they grew up is a great idea. 

There could be some issues with this process though. If you don't know what a person is like how do you know they will fit-in with the others workers. It could destroy the team moral and makes everyone less productive. 

Using blind-hiring technique to set up interviews is a great start to giving everyone equal opportunities. But sitting down and having a face to face interview is still very important. I don't believe diversity-first hiring should be implemented. It forces companies to look at certain demographics, which is exactly what it was created to dissolve. While I believe diversity is extremely important and a huge asset, employees should be hired for their skills first. Race or ethnicity should not be the deciding factor in a hiring process.
